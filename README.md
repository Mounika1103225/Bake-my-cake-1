## Course End Project: Bake My Cake - Phase I

### Context

Cakes, cookies and brownies are all time favorites of young and old. No celebration is complete without these delicacies. The cake shops have started offering options to the customers to bake cakes as per their needs.

In addition, taking the advantage of widely used digital platform, the cake outlets offer options to customers to place their orders online.

  - The delicacies are displayed with attractive images and crisp details like price and rating. ​
- The app should allow to search and filter the items by the user’s preference for a quick selection. ​
- Make the app robust by writing unit test cases for each component created.

### Tasks

##### Task - Design Web page

- Create a Header and Footer in the web page to define the website logo and copyright details.​
